I am Xiao Liu, a second-year master CS student in Tsinghua University, Knowledge Engineering Group (KEG).

- ðŸ”­ Interested in Machine Learning, Data Mining, NLP and Knowledge Graph.
- ðŸŒ± Find my up-to-date publication list in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VKI8EhUAAAAJ)! Some of my proud works:
  * [P-tuning](https://github.com/THUDM/P-tuning) and [P-tuning v2](https://github.com/THUDM/P-tuning-v2): pioneer works on **prompt tuning** for language models
  * [GLM-130B](https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-130B): An Open Bilingual (Enligsh & Chinese) Pre-Trained Model with 130 billion parameters based on [GLM](https://github.com/THUDM/GLM), better than GPT-3 175B on LAMBADA and MMLU.
  * [SelfKG](https://github.com/THUDM/SelfKG): accurate entity alignment without supervision, **Best Paper Nominee** in WWW 2022.
  * [Self-supervised Learning: Generative or Contrastive](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08218.pdf): one of the most cited survey on self-supervised learning
- ðŸ¤” Hope to build a web-scale knowledge system via both Big Pre-trained Model and Symbolic Graph Reasoning.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to drop me an email for:
  * Any form of collaboration
  * Any issue about my works or code
